10/20 Ideas & ToDos

Notes: 
- Check Mumbo's Big Jumbo Galaxy Notebook for my drawings of the website. 
- React has been your worst subject, but it looks like the best resource 
for this project. Try to get the backend MVP done before Lunch on Monday. 
- Make sure the homepage and article page works before doing anything else. 
- You saved the reddit post that has a masterlist of links on what people can do to help on the folder in your bookmark bar. 

-Four  pages: 
    - Homepage: 
    - Article Detail Page 
    - How to Help Page 
    - Login 


Reach goals | Gold Standard: 
    - able to sign up for email alerts 
    - How do you link to sharing with your other sights? I think this 
    was automatically used in the driffle (whatever it was called sight I used Saturday at the Tech Rebalance.
    - Collaberate with Mr. Riffle for a timeline of events | What is happening and Why
