10/20 Ideas & ToDos

Notes: 
- Check Mumbo's Big Jumbo Galaxy Notebook for my drawings of the website. 
- React has been your worst subject, but it looks like the best resource 
for this project. Try to get the backend MVP done before Lunch on Monday. 
- Make sure the homepage and article page works before doing anything else. 
- You saved the reddit post that has a masterlist of links on what people can do to help on the folder in your bookmark bar. 

-Four  pages: 
    - Homepage: 
    - Article Detail Page 
    - How to Help Page 
    - Login 


Reach goals | Gold Standard: 
    - able to sign up for email alerts 
    - How do you link to sharing with your other sights? I think this 
    was automatically used in the driffle (whatever it was called sight I used Saturday at the Tech Rebalance.
    - Collaberate with Mr. Riffle for a timeline of events | What is happening and Why

Couch Work:

- What would it take for the backend to update automatically? 
- DESIGN STUFF: 
    - Color scheme 
    - Rounded borders
    - Slight hover effect 


    Goal for this project: 
    - Trying to recreate a news site and add helpful resources for people that would like to contribute. 
    





Accomplishments: 
- Monday: 
    - Solved a terrible error that was caused by updating my OS to Catalina. 
    - Now that I have updated Mongo the data directory 
    - Run the below command every time to run mongod 
    - Run mongod --dbpath ~/mongo/db


Tuesday Morning Thoughts: 
- How do you get the title to have the value of the link to the article?  
- Originally I wanted a detail page that displayed the entire article, but it looks like I don't have the ability to show that without just linking to the article title. 
    - If that is the case, then I should try to make the article title a link. 
    


What to look for reviewing the API documentation 
- Can you link to the entire article 
- Is there a way to only receive articles that are written in English? 



Thought for another implementation: 
- Would there be a way to make a graph that showed the differt topics that the news are talking about 
    - ie: Lebron James or the leader of Hong Kong's response to the article.
